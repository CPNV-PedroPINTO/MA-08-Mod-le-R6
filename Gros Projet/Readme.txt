## The video-game's name is Rainbow Six Siège. 

The goal of the game is that there are two teams, attackers and defenders. The defenders have to protect a hostage. The attackers have to take the hostage and take him out of the building / game card. The game is very difficult because you need to have a lot of strategy. It is a game that Pedro Pinto and I, Simon Cuany like very much.
